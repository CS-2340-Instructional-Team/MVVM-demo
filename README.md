Simple App that demonstrates an app using MVVM architecture using a button click counter. By default, Activities are recreated in the event of a screen rotation. The click counter will reset for the top button but not the bottom button. This is because the count of the bottom button is not stored in the Activity itself but with a viewModel instead. Thus, this demonstrates the how you can preserve data in an actvity.
